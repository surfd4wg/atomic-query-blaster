# ATOMIC QUERY BLASTER

For use iwth the JupiterOne Python Client API:

- atomic-query-blaster.py - reads queries from a csv file, executes the query against JupiterOne, writes the output to a file
- atomic-querycount-blaster.py - reads queries from a csv file, executes the query, checks if results >0, then writes that query to a second csv file

Thank you!
